# *Java Pedagogical Libraries for Code Analysis*

## *VCU College of Engineering*

## Short Project Description

Adaptation of PEDAL (PEDAgogical Library) from Python to Java
for syntactic analysis of student-submitted code.

Giving large amounts of timely and impactful feedback is difficult because
instructor time in classrooms is becoming more limited as class sizes in
Computer Science continue to grow larger.
To address the scale of current classes and give students timely feedback,
we develop tools for automated student feedback that targets
specific conceptual misunderstandings that can be deployed at-scale and
received immediately.

## Project Structure

The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its
resources self-contained. Open Source software should not just be a repository
of code. There are a number of directories to help you and others who will
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship
program to keep track of your project and get a better understanding of the
problems you encountered during the development of this project.
